### **Problem Statement**
- Today it has become mandatory for all the citizens to wear a face mask to protect themselves . 
- This application can be helpful for all the shop owners, offices, banks or any public place because if anyone is not wearing a mask then he or she must not be allowed in that area. 
- So, to take care of this problem we donâ€™t need any guard or person who keeps a watch on people. We can integrate a camera which continuously clicks pictures of humans and detect from there faces whether they are wearing a face mask or not.


### **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn



### **Model**
The model used in this application was trained by the developer on a custom dataset of images using the RandomForestClassifier algorithm. The algorithm was chosen for its accuracy and robustness in real-world settings.

### *Purpose*
The purpose of this application is to serve as an efficient tool to enforce mask-wearing regulations and help promote public health and safety.
