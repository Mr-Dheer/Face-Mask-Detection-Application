# Face-Mask-Detection-Application

###  Built a face mask classifier that could detect faces and classify whether the detected person is wearing a mask or not. Also, it was implemented on real-time videos and achieved an accuracy of 98%. 

**Problem Statement**
- Today it has become mandatory for all the citizens to wear a face mask to protect themselves . 
- This application can be helpful for all the shop owners, offices, banks or any public place because if anyone is not wearing a mask then he or she must not be allowed in that area. 
- So, to take care of this problem we donâ€™t need any guard or person who keeps a watch on people. We can integrate a camera which continuously clicks pictures of humans and detect from there faces whether they are wearing a face mask or not.
