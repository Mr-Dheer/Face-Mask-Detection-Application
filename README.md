# Face-Mask-Detection-Application

###  The Face Mask Detector is a machine learning based application that I developed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. I created a custom dataset of images of my own and trained the model using the RandomForestClassifier algorithm. The application uses the trained model to classify real-time video feed and determine if a person has a mask on or not. The use of a RandomForestClassifier allowed for accurate classification and ensured the model's robustness in a real-world setting. The application serves as an efficient tool to enforce mask-wearing regulations and helps in promoting public health and safety.

**Problem Statement**
- Today it has become mandatory for all the citizens to wear a face mask to protect themselves . 
- This application can be helpful for all the shop owners, offices, banks or any public place because if anyone is not wearing a mask then he or she must not be allowed in that area. 
- So, to take care of this problem we donâ€™t need any guard or person who keeps a watch on people. We can integrate a camera which continuously clicks pictures of humans and detect from there faces whether they are wearing a face mask or not.
